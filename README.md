# Radiant Rovers Football Academy – Player Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes player-level match performance data from Radiant Rovers Football Academy across 20 competitive matches involving 48 players. 
The analysis applies Python-based data cleaning, PostgreSQL KPI computation, and Power BI visualization to support data-driven coaching and player development decisions.
The project demonstrates how real-world football performance data can be transformed into actionable insights for coaching decisions using data analytics tools.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- PostgreSQL (SQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Summary
- Players: 48
- Matches: 20
- Granularity: Player–match level

### Key Features
- Player ID, Name, Age, Position
- Match ID, Match Date, Minutes Played
- Goals, Assists, Shots on Target
- Passing Accuracy
- Fitness Score, Stamina, Speed
- Training Attendance

## Workflow
1. Data collected manually during matches by the coach
2. Data cleaning and feature engineering using Python
3. KPI computation using PostgreSQL
4. Interactive dashboard creation using Power BI

## Key KPIs
